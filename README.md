# Workflow: good practices for efficient and reproductible data analysis


Before the session please do the following:

- Download and install R on your personal computer: (https://cran.dcc.uchile.cl)[`[Here]`]
Download and install RStudio on your personal computer
Optionally,

Download and install the text editor SublimeText3.
Open SublimeText and follow the instructions here step-by-step. Notice that the procedure is different depending on whether you are a Windows or MacOS user.
Because of time constraints, I will not be covering how to use R and SublimeText together, but if you are interested we can talk about it after the class.
