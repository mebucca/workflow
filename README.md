# First steps

Before the session please do the following:


- Sign into Overleaf: [`[here]`](https://it.overleaf.com/login)
- Download and install R on your personal computer: [`[here]`](https://cran.dcc.uchile.cl)
- Download and install RStudio on your personal computer: [`[here]`](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- Download and install Zotero on your personal computer: [`[here]`](https://www.zotero.org/download/)


Optionally,

- Download and install the text editor SublimeText: [`[here]`](https://www.sublimetext.com)

Open SublimeText and follow this [`[guide]`](https://docs.sublimetext.io/guide/) step-by-step. Notice that the procedure is different depending on whether you are a Windows or MacOS user. Because of time constraints, I will not be covering how to use R and SublimeText together, but if you are interested we can talk about it after the class.
